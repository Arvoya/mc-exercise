# README

Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo

So I did this assignment with a TA, and I acted as Bob & Carol while she was Ted & Alice. The biggest issue that occurred was when both groups continued making changes by making various branches, while some of the group was merging the changes on GitHub. So the main branch was being modified without the groups pulling from main, and so while the new branches contained changes, they weren't updating their local Repo's properly.
